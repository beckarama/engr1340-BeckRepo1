# Integer Addition

Integer addition is the process of combining two whole numbers to get a single result called a sum.

## How It Works

Every integer is either positive, negative, or zero. How you add two integers depends on their signs:

### Same Signs
If both integers are positive or both are negative, add their absolute values and keep the sign.

Example: 2+2 = 4 

Example 2: 5 + 5 = 10

Multiplication works by imagining groups of things so a*b would be "a groups of b things." Then you take the total amout of items.
4\*3=12
