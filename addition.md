The addition of two integers works by combining magnitutdes or finding their differences if the signs are different. If signs are the same, simply add the absolute values. Example: 2+2 = 4 

Example 2: 5 + 5 = 10

Multiplication works by imagining groups of things so a*b would be "a groups of b things." Then you take the total amout of items.
4\*3=12
